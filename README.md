## Overview

The Incapsula ___utmvc cookie is part of an outdated protection mechanism from Incapsula. This protection relied on:
1. A dynamic endpoint serving obfuscated JavaScript
2. Browser fingerprinting and analysis
3. RC4 encryption with a dynamic key
4. Cookie-based authentication for protected endpoints

While this method is now outdated, it's still used by websites that haven't updated their security measures in years.

## Features

- üîê Decrypt ___utmvc cookies
- üîç Analyze browser fingerprinting data
- üîë Extract decryption keys from obfuscated scripts
- üìã Copy results in formatted JSON
- üîó Shareable URLs for easy collaboration
- üåê Web-based interface, no installation needed

## How It Works

The protection flow works as follows:

1. Website serves an obfuscated JavaScript file
2. Script collects browser information
3. Data is combined with script-based hashes
4. RC4 encryption is applied using a dynamic key
5. Result is set as the `___utmvc` cookie
6. Cookie is used for subsequent request authentication

## Technical Details

The decryption process involves:

1. **Key Extraction**: Using the `file-analyzer` module (based on my old[Incapsula-utmvc-Deobfuscator](https://github.com/glizzykingdreko/Incapsula-utmvc-Deobfuscator)) to deobfuscate the script and extract the encryption key
2. **RC4 Decryption**: Reversing the RC4 encryption using the extracted key
3. **Data Parsing**: Analyzing the decrypted data to extract browser fingerprinting information

You can find the complete decryption process in the [`decryptor.js`](decryptor.js) file.

## Usage

1. Visit the [online tool](https://glizzykingdreko.github.io/incapsula-___utmvc-cookie-decryptor)

The tool is also available on Vercel at [vercel-url]

2. Input your __utmvc cookie
3. Either:
   - Paste the full Incapsula script
   - Or just the 5-character decryption key
4. Click "Analyze" to see the decrypted results
